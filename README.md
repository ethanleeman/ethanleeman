### Ethan Leeman

Hello! I am a Senior Software Engineer at Google in the Privacy Sandbox team working in the intersection of machine learning and data privacy. You can find my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BvoT1eIAAAAJ&hl=en) here. Previously I was a Research Software Engineer at [Composable Analytics](https://composable.ai/). Here are some interesting things here on github I have done in the past: 

* [CycleAnalyist](https://github.com/ethanleeman/Cycle-Analyst). See the live app [here](http://cycle-analyst.herokuapp.com/). This app uses OpenStreetMap, DVRPC Bicycle Traffic Data, and PennDot Crash Data to route cyclists in Downtown Philadelphia away from dangerous intersections.
* [CAMS](https://github.com/AIMS-Ghana/cams). Helped build the Computation in Applied Mathematical Sciences workshop at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences. A program for STEM Masters students in Africa to develop and apply mathematical scientific research using computational tools, CAMS is made possible by a partnership between AIMS Ghana and the US Office of Naval Research, Global Division.
